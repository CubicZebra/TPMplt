Description: Provides a simple approach for constructing dynamic materials
  modeling suggested by Prasad and Gegel <doi:10.1007/BF02664902>. It
  can easily generate various processing-maps based on this model as well. The 
  calculation result in this package contains full materials constants, information
  about power dissipation efficiency factor, and rheological properties, can
  be exported completely also, through which further analysis and customized
  plots will be applicable as well.
