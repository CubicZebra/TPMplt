Description: Provides a simple approach for constructing dynamic materials
 modeling suggested by Prasad and Gegel (1984) <doi:10.1007/BF02664902>. It
 can easily generate various processing-maps based on this model as well. The
 calculation result in this package contains full materials constants, information
 about power dissipation efficiency factor, and rheological properties, can
 be exported completely also, through which further analysis and customized
 plots will be applicable as well.
